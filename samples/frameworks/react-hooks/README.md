- Capture and process documents from video stream
- Automatic document detection and cropping
- Mobile-optimized scanning interface
- TypeScript support with type definitions

## Requirements

- **Node.js 20.19.0 or later**
- [Base requirements](https://www.dynamsoft.com/mobile-document-scanner/docs/web/introduction/index.html#system-requirements)

## Quick Start

We publish **MDS** library files on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamsoft-document-scanner) to make them simple to reference from a CDN. We reference the library files in our _ready-made_ Hello World sample for React included in our GitHub source repository:

1. Download **MDS** from [GitHub](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/document-scanner-javascript) as a compressed folder.

2. Extract the contents of the archive, and open the extracted directory in a code editor.

3. Set your [license key](#get-a-trial-license) in the **React framework sample**:
    1. Open the sample at [`/samples/frameworks/react-hooks/src/App.tsx`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/document-scanner-javascript/blob/main/document-scanner-javascript-dev/samples/frameworks/react-hooks/src/App.tsx).
    2. Search for `"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"`, then replace it with your actual license key.

### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Start the App

```shell
npm start
```

Then open https://localhost:3000/ to view the sample app.
