- Mobile-optimized scanning interface
- TypeScript support with type definitions

## Quick Start

We publish **MDS** library files on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dynamsoft-document-scanner) to make them simple to reference from a CDN. We reference the library files in our _ready-made_ Hello World sample for Vue included in our GitHub source repository:

1. Download **MDS** from [GitHub](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/document-scanner-javascript) as a compressed folder.

2. Extract the contents of the archive, and open the extracted directory in a code editor.

3. Set your [license key](#get-a-trial-license) in the **Vue framework sample**:
    1. Open the sample at [`/samples/frameworks/vue/src/App.vue`](https://github.com/Dynamsoft/document-scanner-javascript/blob/main/document-scanner-javascript-dev/samples/frameworks/vue/src/App.vue).
    2. Search for `"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY_HERE"`, then replace it with your actual license key.

### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Start the App

```shell
npm run serve
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ to view the sample app.
