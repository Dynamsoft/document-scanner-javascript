# Document Scanner Samples

Here we present sample projects built with the Mobile Document Scanner, each a single HTML file to demonstrate a particular use case or feature of MDS.

## Plain JavaScript Samples

1. [Hello World](./hello-world.html) - a minimal example to get started with scanning single page documents in under 2 minutes.
2. [Official Demo](./demo/index.html) - source code for the polished and integrated demo application on our website.
3. [Scanning to PDF](./scenarios/scanning-to-pdf.html) - scan multi-page documents with MDS, and integrate with Dynamsoft Document Viewer (DDV) for viewing, editing, and PDF file output.
4. [Multi-Page Scanning](./scenarios/multi-page-scanning.html) - scan multi-page documents with MDS and output as separate images on each successful scan for further fine-grain processing downstream.
5. [Image File Scanning](./scenarios/image-file-scanning.html) - scan documents from file input instead of a camera feed for processing existing images.

## JavaScript Framework Samples

All three Framework samples provide the same features as the plain JavaScript Hello World sample.

1. [Angular](./frameworks/angular/README.md)
2. [React Hooks](./frameworks/react-hooks/README.md)
3. [Vue](./frameworks/vue/README.md)
